myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(myset)
#set is very simiar to tuple but only the difference is set is unordered and does not allow duplicate value while tuple is ordered, both are definitely unchanged 


myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"} # it doesn't print or send out an error mesage but it also doesn't print the duplicate value.
print(myset)



#like i stated earlier tuple and set is pretty much the same thing with a little difference
